April 11, 2007

	Initial commit by Steve Hannah, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Simon Fraser University.
	
	This version is the preliminary version of auction created for the SFU 
	plant sale.  It is not ready for general distribution because it requires 
	LDAP to get user info.  It is also set up by default to use CAS.
	
	These settings can be changed in the conf.ini file.
